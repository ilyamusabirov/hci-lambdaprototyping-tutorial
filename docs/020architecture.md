# Architectural intro

## Key ideas

Serverless, or more specifically Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) approach is the next logical step of cloud concept. 
In FaaS designer can focus on authoring functions, delegating to cloud platform all responsibilities related to code deployment and execution.

Most FaaS platforms, including AWS Lambda, provide different ways to execute functions:

- by direct request from user software bindings
- by trigger generated by other cloud services (e.g. on uploading file to cloud storage)
- by request proxied by RESTful API (using AWS API Gateway in case of AWS)

We will ignore most of software architecture implications and focus only on what does it mean for designers involved in prototyping:

- quick way to prototype user-facing product logic and bring to user via request-responce interface (e.g. WebAPI, messenger-based interface)
- quick way to connect multiple external cloud (e.g. SaaS) services (with Web API on language bindings) in custom pipelines more sofisticated than Zappier et al
- access to other lower level cloud services from the same or other platforms, handy to expand prototype or support transition to a product (e.g. file storage service, 
notification and pub-sub services, ML model deployment services, AI APIs (text recognition, sentiment analysis, image, video and voice APIs)) 
- minimal forward commitment to a particular architecture/infrastructure
- opportunity to develop prototype function by function, limiting cognitive load and prototype development management complexity

## Key services and software

- [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/) - Python framework for quick development of serverless APIs [on AWS Lambda (serverless Flask), abstracting out most of the services complexity
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - AWS FaaS platform allowing to quickly develop product login in Python, NodeJS, other platforms
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) - AWS service to map user-facing WebAPI to Lambda calls
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) - serverless AWS key-value database

## Addtional useful services

- AWS SageMaker - ML model development and deployment service (jupyter notebook to Web API)
- AWS S3 - simple object file storage
